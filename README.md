# Generative Piece — Divinity Visuals

This project is an interactive generative artwork built in **Processing**.  
It combines audio-reactive visuals by **Gerard** and **Sandra**, inspired by the song **Divinity** from Porter Robinson’s album Worlds.  
The piece explores the interplay between music and visuals through strobing shapes, particles, and symbolic overlays.
